# Motion System Refactoring

## Overview

The Motion System has been refactored to improve maintainability, scalability, and adhere to the single responsibility principle. The original `MotionSystem.gd` file was getting too large and handling too many responsibilities, making it harder to maintain and extend.

## New Architecture

The refactored system follows a modular architecture with the following components:

### Core Components

1. **MotionSystem.gd**
   - Lightweight wrapper that delegates to the core components
   - Maintains the same public API for backward compatibility
   - Forwards signals from the core system

2. **MotionSystemCore.gd**
   - Central coordinator that manages subsystems
   - Handles configuration loading
   - Delegates specific tasks to specialized components

3. **PhysicsCalculator.gd**
   - Handles physics-related calculations
   - Provides utility functions for gravity, friction, etc.
   - Encapsulates physics logic

4. **MotionStateManager.gd**
   - Manages entity state (launched, sliding, etc.)
   - Handles state transitions
   - Processes frame-based motion

### Motion Resolution Components

5. **ContinuousMotionResolver.gd**
   - Handles continuous motion resolution
   - Collects and processes modifiers from subsystems
   - Resolves scalar values (like friction)

6. **CollisionMotionResolver.gd**
   - Handles collision-based motion resolution
   - Processes bounce and slide logic
   - Manages collision response

7. **MotionDebugger.gd**
   - Provides debug functionality
   - Logs motion-related information
   - Helps with troubleshooting

## Subsystem Integration

Subsystems continue to work the same way as before, implementing the `IMotionSubsystem` interface. The refactored system maintains backward compatibility with existing subsystems.

## Benefits of the Refactoring

1. **Improved Maintainability**: Each component has a clear, focused responsibility
2. **Better Scalability**: New features can be added to the appropriate component
3. **Enhanced Readability**: Smaller files are easier to understand
4. **Easier Testing**: Components can be tested in isolation
5. **DRY Principles**: Common functionality is centralized
6. **Single Responsibility**: Each class has one reason to change

## Usage

The public API of `MotionSystem.gd` remains unchanged, so existing code that uses the Motion System should continue to work without modification. The refactoring is internal and should be transparent to users of the system.

## Recent Improvements

1. **Automatic Subsystem Registration**: MotionSystemCore now automatically registers all subsystems from a predefined list, eliminating the need for manual registration in Game.gd.
2. **Centralized Physics Config Access**: Removed duplicate physics_config variables from subsystems, ensuring all subsystems access the physics configuration through MotionSystemCore.
3. **Standardized Error Handling**: Improved how subsystems handle missing physics configuration with consistent error messages and fallback behavior. All subsystems now use the centralized ErrorHandler for logging instead of direct push_error/push_warning calls.
4. **Reduced Code Duplication**: Eliminated redundant code for loading and accessing physics configuration.
5. **Simplified Game Initialization**: Game.gd no longer needs to manually create and register each subsystem, making it more maintainable.
6. **Improved Signal Handling**: Fixed signal connections between subsystems by:
   - Adding entity_launched signal directly to LaunchSystem
   - Implementing proper signal forwarding in MotionSystemCore
   - Ensuring BounceSystem receives launch events correctly
7. **Dynamic Subsystem Registration**: Improved subsystem registration to be more dynamic:
   - Moved subsystem registration out of MotionSystemCore._ready() to allow explicit control
   - Added explicit call to register_all_subsystems() in Game.initialize_motion_system()
   - Fixed timing issues with subsystem registration and availability

## Subsystem Physics Config Access Pattern

Subsystems now follow a consistent pattern for accessing physics configuration:

```gdscript
# Ensure motion system and config are available
if not _motion_system or not _motion_system.has_method("get_physics_config"):
    ErrorHandler.error("SubsystemName", "MotionSystem or get_physics_config method not available.")
    return fallback_value
var current_physics_config = _motion_system.get_physics_config()
if not current_physics_config:
    ErrorHandler.error("SubsystemName", "Physics config not available from MotionSystem.")
    return fallback_value
    
# Now use current_physics_config to access physics parameters
var param = current_physics_config.some_parameter
```

This pattern ensures consistent error handling and fallback behavior across all subsystems.

## Future Improvements

1. **Enhanced Debugging**: The MotionDebugger could be extended with visualization tools
2. **More Specialized Components**: As the system grows, additional components could be added
3. **Performance Optimizations**: The modular architecture makes it easier to optimize specific parts
4. **Testing Framework**: Unit tests could be added for each component
5. **Dynamic Subsystem Discovery**: The system could be extended to automatically discover and register subsystems without requiring a predefined list
6. **Subsystem Dependencies**: Add support for subsystems to declare dependencies on other subsystems
