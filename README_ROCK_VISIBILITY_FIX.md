# Rock Visibility Fix

## Problem

The rocks in the game were appearing stacked vertically with similar X coordinates, rather than being spread out horizontally across the ground. This made them difficult to see and interact with.

## Cause

The issue was caused by two main factors:

1. **Debug Scripts Creating Extra Rocks**: Multiple debug scripts were creating additional rocks for testing purposes:
   - VisibleRocksTest.gd: Creates a 3x3 grid of rocks (9 total)
   - RockObstacleTest.gd: Creates 1 test rock + 5 rocks in a pattern (6 total)
   - FixRocksNotAppearing.gd: Creates 1 test rock

2. **Incorrect Rock Positioning**: In the ContentFactory.gd script, rocks were being positioned with their Y coordinate set to the "distance" value, causing them to be stacked vertically instead of being placed at ground level.

## Solution

The solution has two parts:

1. **Disable Debug Scripts**: A new script (DisableDebugRocks.gd) has been created to find and disable all debug scripts that create rocks. This script is loaded at game startup.

2. **Fix Rock Positioning**: The ContentFactory.gd script has been modified to ensure that rocks are always positioned at ground level (Y=0) while maintaining their horizontal spread (X position).

## Implementation Details

### DisableDebugRocks

The DisableDebugRocks.gd script:
- Finds and removes any instances of the debug scenes
- Finds and disables any instances of the debug scripts
- Runs at game startup before any other initialization

### ContentFactory Fix

The _set_instance_position function in ContentFactory.gd has been modified to:
- Detect if the instance is a RockObstacle or in the "obstacles" group
- For obstacles, set the Y position to 0 (ground level) regardless of the distance value
- Use the width_offset for the X position to maintain horizontal spread
- Use the distance value for z-index to handle depth sorting

```gdscript
# Special case for obstacles (like rocks) - always place at ground level (y=0)
if instance is RockObstacle or (instance.get_groups().has("obstacles")):
    # For obstacles, use width_offset for X and always set Y to 0
    position_2d = Vector2(width_offset, 0)
    
    # Use distance for z-index to handle depth sorting
    # Higher distance = further away = lower z-index
    instance.z_index = 1000 - int(distance / 10)
else:
    # For other objects, use the original positioning
    position_2d = Vector2(width_offset, distance)
```

## Results

With these changes:
1. Only the rocks generated by the normal content system will appear
2. All rocks will be positioned at ground level (Y=0)
3. Rocks will be spread out horizontally based on their width_offset
4. Rocks will be sorted by depth based on their distance value

## Verification

You can verify the fix is working by:
1. Running the game
2. Observing that rocks are now spread out horizontally across the ground
3. Checking the console logs for messages from DisableDebugRocks
4. Looking for debug messages showing rock positions with Y=0
